  sentences:
  - A terrorist attack? Here?!
  - "It seems the Imperial Army is keeping this rebellion a secret for some reason\u2026
    But why?"
  - "Well, as long as they\u2019re trying to suppress this information, it\u2019ll
    be hard for them to call in reinforcements."
  - Even so, being surrounded like this makes it difficult for me to stay hidden.
  - ... Or do I even need to anymore?
  - Pathetic terrorist, what kind of hunt is this if all you do is run away?
  - Dammit, I barely have any energy left!
  - I can't afford to die now, everyone else is still counting on me.
  - But there's just no way out of this situation. What should I do?!
  - Take the next exit! Follow the path until you see the railroad tracks, then keep
    to it!
  - Who is this?! And how do you know this radio transmission?
  - "There\u2019s no time to explain. If you want to win, then trust me!"
  - ... Win?
