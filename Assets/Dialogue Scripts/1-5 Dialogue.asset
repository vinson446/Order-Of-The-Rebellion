  sentences:
  - "We\u2019ve captured their commander sir. Apparently he\u2019s quite a big deal,
    a prince even, according to his words."
  - Bring him to me, then leave us. I want to talk to him in private.
  - Yes sir.
  - So this is the great enemy commander who I lost to.
  - Well? What does a plebeian like you want with someone like me?
  - "As prideful as always it seems. Though this does bring back familiar memories
    doesn\u2019t it Prince Clovis."
  - Huh? You...who are you?
  - "It\u2019s been a long time...big brother."
  - The eldest son of the late Empress Marianne and 6th in line to the Imperial throne.
    NAME of the Holy Imperial Empire, at your service.
  - NAME?! But I thought-
  - That I was dead? I have returned, Your Highness.
  - To change everything.
