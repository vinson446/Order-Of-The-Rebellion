  - Hey you on the radio! What do I do now?!
  - Since you trusted me, you get to win.
  - Did you really think you could escape from me brat?
  - Just wait till I- GAHHHHHH
  - 'F- Friendly fire?! What squadron are you from?! '
  - "Can\u2019t you see the enemy is the one running away you moron! "
  - "Can it be...a terrorist?! That\u2019s impossible! You...you son of a\u2026"
  - GRAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
  - Thanks for saving me! But how did you manage to get your hands on an enemy Mekka?
  - Hey! Kallen! Who was that on the radio?
  - Ohgi! Thank god you made it out safely.
  - Are you the leader?
  - Huh? Yeah.
  - "On the railroad, the cargo coming in now is my gift to you. They\u2019re tools
    for your victory."
  - If you wish to use them and win, then follow my orders.
  - "All of this\u2026? But how\u2026"
  - "Distribute these weapons to your men. In ten minutes, I\u2019ll contact you
    with your next instructions."
  - "\"This is completely nerve-wracking. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m leading these
    rebels against the empire.\""
  - "\"Still, I need the determination to succeed. This is my life I\u2019m betting
    now after all.\""
  - Your Highness, It seems the terrorists are mixed among the general populace and
    are mounting a bit of resistance against us.
  - "Of course this hasn\u2019t affected our army\u2019s overwhelming superiority
    in the slightest."
  - "Naturally. It does seem like we\u2019ve been too lenient on this settlement
    however."
  - "Send in both Lazlo\u2019s squad and Globe\u2019s squad. Let us end their pathetic
    attempt at a rebellion once and for all."
  - 'Hey Ohgi, you sure we can trust this guy? '
  - "There\u2019s even Mekkas here! How do we know this isn\u2019t an enemy trap? "
  - "The other side has the complete advantage in this war. There\u2019s no need
    for them to set any traps."
  - "That\u2019s right. You guys get to your assigned points, I\u2019ll-"
  - Enemy attack incoming from the northeast!
  - "What\u2019s he talking about? I don\u2019t see anything!"
  - Everyone, double check your weapons.
  - Hey! Are you being for real right now?!
  - The terrorists are in sight! Kill them all!
  - But how did he...?
  - "As if we\u2019d let you Imperialist scum!"
